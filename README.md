## Data Flow
In this project, we have four layers-

* Controller-The controller layer handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business (service) layer. In short, it consists of views ie, frontend part.

* Repository - Here database is stored, for which I have used arrayList. In the database layer, CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations are performed.

* Service- This layer Return to the Dao .

* Model - The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers. • DataBase Class - Here the class user is defined and the whatever a user class will load, eg-userld, userName, address, phone number etc.
